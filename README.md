mGollective - experiments with mcollective and Go

This is a twofold learning project, I want to understand the protocols that
mcollective uses on the wire, and also to play with writing something with Go

To start with I'm using the mcollective-vagrant test vms, so it'll be a redis
adaptor.

There's also a stomp module for doing the activemq stuff, maybe.
